It seems primarily intended for use in games or simulations, rather than actual police work.",
    "color": "The main body of the car is black, with the windows in the cabin tinted light blue/gray. The roof's emergency light bar is blue, and the signal lights at both ends are orange.",
    "shape": "The car's design is boxy and straightforward with a trapezoidal cabin shape. It has a prominent light bar on the roof and a typical four-wheel setup. The overall form resembles a sedan-style police car, characterized by simple, clean lines.",
    "count": "There is one police car.",
    "spatial": "The blue emergency light bar is centrally positioned on the vehicle's roof.",
    "usage": "This 3D model is suitable for use in various digital applications such as video games, educational programs about emergency services, children\u2019s media, or simplified simulations of city environments. It is ideal for projects that require a stylized, low-polygon visual style rather than a realistic depiction."
